Here’s the problem: students collect information from everywhere (slides, whiteboards, textbooks, PDFs, recorded lectures) but it ends up scattered across camera rolls, downloads, and apps. Organizing and turning that into something useful takes hours they don’t have. Our app solves that. It knows your class schedule, so content taken during lecture, let it be pictures, documents, audio, or just text are instantly sorted into the right subject and converted into clean, AI-generated notes.  In other words, we’re the ultimate study assistant.
